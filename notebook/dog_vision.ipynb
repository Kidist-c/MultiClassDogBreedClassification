    " This notebook builds an end-to-end multi-class image classifier using Tensorflow and Tensorflow Hub\n",

    "* Identifiying the breed of dog given an image of the dog.\n",
    "* when I am sitting at cafe and I take the photo of  a dog. I want to know its breed.\n",
    "#### Data \n",
    "* The data we are using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition\n",
    "#### Evaluation\n",
    "* The evaluation is a file with predicition probabilities for each dog breed of each test image.\n",

    "*  some information about the data \n",
    "    * we're dealing with Images(unstructured data) so it's probably best if we use deep learning or transfer learning\n",

    "    * There are around 10,000+ images in the training set with label.\n",
